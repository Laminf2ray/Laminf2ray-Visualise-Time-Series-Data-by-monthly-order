Visualise Time Series Data by monthly order.
1. Brief definition of Time Series Data
2. How to import data from SQL Server in Pandas.
3. Import libraries for data manipulations, visualizations and connection

We import pyodbc an open-source Python module that makes accessing ODBC databases simple. 

We wrote the query in the SQL Server Management Studio then we copy and paste the code into the Jupyter Notebook.

Brief definition of Time series data, also known as time-stamped data, is a series of data points indexed in time order.

These data points usually consist of consecutive measurements made from the same source over a fixed time period and are used to track change over time.

The time series data we worked on is UK Bike monthly sales in the year 2013. 

The data is imported from the AdventureWork2012 database (is an open source).
